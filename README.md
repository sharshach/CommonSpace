#### How Github Copilot Chat Helped
## How Copilot Helped
GitHub Copilot played a crucial role in creating the React application quickly and efficiently. It provided intelligent code suggestions, helped in writing boilerplate code, and acted as a coding partner throughout the development process. This allowed for faster implementation of features and ensured a smoother coding experience. Copilot's ability to understand the context and provide relevant code snippets significantly reduced development time and improved productivity. [Commands to Copilot (6-25)](./copilot.md)
